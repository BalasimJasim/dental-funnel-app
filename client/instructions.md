1. Project Overview
Project Name:
Funnel Web App with Appointment System

Goal:
Create a minimalistic and user-friendly web app that serves as a sales funnel for a dental clinic. The app will include features to guide users to suitable services, display personalized service recommendations, allow users to book appointments, and prepare for future integration with the clinic's management system (Cliniccards).

Tech Stack:
Frontend (React):
Vite: For fast development and optimized builds.
CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS: For styling.
Axios: For communication with the backend.
Backend (Express):
Node.js and Express: For the REST API.
Mongoose: For database models (if needed for appointment storage).
Dummy Data for Cliniccards Integration: Placeholder data to simulate the management system.
Database:
MongoDB: To store appointments (if needed).
Deployment:
Frontend: Deploy on Vercel.
Backend: Deploy on Render.
2. Features Requirements
Frontend Features:
Landing Page:
Eye-catching, minimalistic design.
A clear call-to-action (CTA): "Discover Your Perfect Smile" or "Find the Best Dental Solution for You."
Highlight clinic services and benefits (e.g., "Affordable Prices, Modern Equipment, Experienced Dentists").
Service Guidance:
Users answer 3–5 simple questions to find the most relevant service (e.g., implants, dentures, teeth whitening).
Results include a summary of the service and its value.
Appointment Booking System:
Simple calendar-based system to allow users to choose a time slot and provide their contact information.
Price Estimation:
Show approximate costs for services based on user inputs (dummy data can simulate the price logic).
User Experience:
Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
Clear navigation and feedback for user actions.
API Integration with Dummy Data:
Use mock data to simulate integration with Cliniccards (e.g., dummy appointments, placeholder service list).
Backend Features:
REST API Endpoints:
POST /api/appointments: Save appointment details.
GET /api/services: Fetch clinic services and pricing (dummy data for now).
POST /api/service-guidance: Process user responses and return recommended services.
Dummy Data for Cliniccards Integration:
Use a placeholder JSON file or database collection to simulate Cliniccards.
Design the data structure to align with expected Cliniccards data (e.g., appointments, services).
Security:
Use environment variables for sensitive data.
Validate and sanitize user input.
